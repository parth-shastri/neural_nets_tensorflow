# neural_nets_tensorflow
Just a small set of projects from a student who loves to play with the artificial thinking!


THIS INCLUDES ALMOST ALL KINDS OF MODELS IN TENSORFLOW REALTED WITH IMAGE CLASSIFICATION, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, RNN, LSTMS, OCR RECOGNITION,etc.
Ive learnt these codes from the tensorflow website tutorials and fine_tuned them according to my usage.
This also includes a code from the paper written by Intel on Lightweight License plate recognition. Their model known as LPRNet.
